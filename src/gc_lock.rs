//! A `DeleteGuard` prevents block deletion while either a backup is pending,
//! or if a band is created concurrently with garbage enumeration, or if
//! another gc operation is underway.
//!
//! Deletion of blocks works by: finding all the blocks that are present,
//! then finding all the blocks that are referenced, then deleting the
//! blocks that are present but unreferenced.
//!
//! This matches the order in which data is written to the archive: data
//! blocks first, and then the index hunks that reference them.
//!
//! However, if a backup was running concurrently with garbage collection,
//! it's possible that we'd see the block and read the index before the
//! backup gets around to writing the index.
//!
//! Therefore, before starting enumeration, we check the latest band id,
//! and if it exists it must be complete. Then, after finding the blocks to
//! delete but before starting to actually delete them, we check that no
//! new bands have been created.
