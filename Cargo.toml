description = """A robust backup tool.

Conserve copies files, directories, and (on Unix) symlinks from a local source
tree, to a compressed archive directory, and retrieves them on demand.

The primary interface is the `conserve` command-line tool, and the key commands
are:

    conserve init /backup/home.conserve
    conserve backup /backup/home.conserve ~
    conserve restore /backup/home.conserve /tmp/trial-restore
