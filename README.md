# Conserve - a robust backup program

**At this time Conserve can make and restore backups, but should
not be relied upon for production use:
[more details](#Shortcomings).**

Conserve backs up trees of files and directories and (only on Unix)
symlinks.  Data is compressed and stored into an *archive* directory
which retains multiple versions of a single source tree.

Conserve's homepage is: <https://github.com/sourcefrog/conserve>

## Use

    conserve init /backup/home.conserve
    conserve backup /backup/home.conserve ~
    conserve restore /backup/home.conserve /tmp/source-restore
    conserve --help

For more details see the
[`conserve(1)`](https://github.com/sourcefrog/conserve/blob/master/man/conserve.asciidoc)
man page.

## Install

Conserve runs on Unix, OS X, and Windows.

To build Conserve you need [Rust][rust] and a C compiler that can be used by
Rust.

Then simply run

    $ cargo build

[rust]: https://rust-lang.org/

## Shortcomings

Conserve is still in a pre-1.0 alpha.  It can be used to make and restore
backups, but there are some important performance and functional limitations,
which will be fixed before 1.0.

* [Data compression is slow][32].
* There are no incremental backups: all backups store all files.
* [There is no way to exclude files/subdirectories from backup or restore][8].
* [The planned `validate` command is not implemented][5],
however a trial restore from the archive will .
* The planned feature of resuming an interrupted backup is not implemented:
Conserve will just create a new full backup from the beginning.
* `conserve diff` is also not implemented, but can be simulated by restoring to
a temporary directory and comparing that to the source.
* The `conserve cull` command to trim the backup archive is not implemented,
but the `b0123` band directories can be deleted directly.
* You can only restore the most recent backup, not a named older one.
* Permissions and ownership are not stored.

Prior to 1.0, data formats may change on each minor version number change (0.x):
you should restore using the same version that you used to make the backup.
